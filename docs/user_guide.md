# Battery Impedance Analyzer User Guide

## Introduction

The Battery Impedance Analyzer is a comprehensive software toolkit that utilizes Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to evaluate battery health, predict degradation, and optimize battery pack composition. This guide will help you understand how to use the software effectively.

## Installation

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Linux
- Python 3.8 or higher
- USB port for hardware connections
- Minimum 8GB RAM and 4GB free disk space

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JJshome/battery-impedance-analyzer.git
   cd battery-impedance-analyzer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Connect your impedance measurement hardware (if applicable)

4. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Main Interface

The Battery Impedance Analyzer interface consists of five main sections:

1. **Connection Panel**: Configure hardware connections and test parameters
2. **Measurement Panel**: Initiate and control impedance measurements
3. **Analysis Panel**: Process and analyze measurement data
4. **Visualization Panel**: Display results in various formats
5. **Report Panel**: Generate and export reports

## Workflow

### 1. Connect to Hardware
- Select the appropriate port from the dropdown menu
- Click "Connect" to establish communication with your measurement hardware
- Verify connection status indicator turns green

### 2. Configure Measurement Parameters
- Set frequency range (default: 10kHz to 10mHz)
- Set number of data points (default: 50)
- Set integration time (default: 0.5s per point)
- Set amplitude (default: 10mV)

### 3. Perform Measurements
- Click "Start Measurement" to begin the impedance sweep
- Monitor progress in the status bar
- View real-time data in the plot window
- Measurement will automatically stop when complete

### 4. Analyze Results
- Choose analysis type:
  - **Circuit Fitting**: Fit data to equivalent circuit models
  - **SOH Estimation**: Calculate state of health
  - **Parameter Extraction**: Extract key battery parameters
  - **Degradation Analysis**: Predict remaining useful life

### 5. Visualize Data
- **Nyquist Plot**: Complex impedance plot (Z' vs. -Z")
- **Bode Plot**: Magnitude and phase vs. frequency
- **Cole-Cole Plot**: Real vs. imaginary parts of complex capacitance
- **Circuit Parameters**: View fitted parameters with confidence intervals

### 6. Generate Reports
- Click "Generate Report" to create a comprehensive analysis
- Choose report format (PDF, HTML, XLSX)
- Add custom notes and observations
- Save report to your preferred location

## Advanced Features

### Battery Pack Optimization
The Battery Pack Optimization tool helps you select the optimal combination of batteries for pack assembly:

1. Measure multiple batteries individually
2. Navigate to "Tools > Battery Pack Optimization"
3. Select the measured battery data files
4. Choose optimization criteria (parallel/series, capacity matching, impedance matching)
5. Review recommendations and export battery groupings

### Temperature Correlation Analysis
To understand how temperature affects battery impedance:

1. Configure temperature sensor in "Settings > Hardware Configuration"
2. Perform measurements at different temperatures
3. Navigate to "Analysis > Temperature Correlation"
4. View thermal-impedance maps and extract activation energies

### Batch Processing
For analyzing large sets of batteries:

1. Navigate to "File > Batch Processing"
2. Select multiple data files or a directory of files
3. Choose analysis parameters and processing options
4. Run batch analysis and view summary results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Hardware Connection Failures**
- Ensure USB cable is securely connected
- Check if the correct COM port is selected
- Verify hardware is powered on
- Try a different USB port or cable

**Measurement Errors**
- Check electrode connections for proper contact
