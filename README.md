# Battery Impedance Analysis System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Battery Impedance Analysis System designed for electric vehicle battery diagnostics. The system utilizes Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to evaluate battery health, estimate remaining useful life, and detect potential issues before they lead to battery failure.

> **Note**: Ucaretron Inc. is currently developing an Impedance SoC (System on Chip) with an integrated Analog Frontend for battery diagnostics. This repository serves as a reference implementation for software components that would interact with such hardware.

## Features
- Real-time battery impedance measurement across multiple frequency ranges (10 mHz ~ 10 kHz)
- Equivalent circuit modeling for parameter extraction
- Pattern matching algorithm for impedance spectrum analysis
- Cell grouping for optimizing battery pack assembly
- State of Health (SoH) estimation
- Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction
- Early fault detection
- Cell balancing recommendations

## System Architecture
