## üìù Usage Examples

### Basic Impedance Measurement

```python
from battery_analyzer import ImpedanceAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = ImpedanceAnalyzer()

# Connect to the measurement hardware
analyzer.connect(port='/dev/ttyUSB0')

# Run a frequency sweep from 10kHz to 10mHz
data = analyzer.measure_impedance(freq_start=10000, freq_end=0.01, points=50)

# Plot the Nyquist diagram
analyzer.plot_nyquist(data)

# Export the results
analyzer.export_data(data, "results.csv")
```

### Battery Health Assessment

```python
from battery_analyzer import BatteryHealth

# Initialize with a battery model
health_analyzer = BatteryHealth(model='lithium_ion_18650')

# Load impedance data
health_analyzer.load_data("impedance_data.csv")

# Fit equivalent circuit model
params = health_analyzer.fit_circuit_model('randles')

# Calculate state of health
soh = health_analyzer.calculate_soh()
print(f"Battery State of Health: {soh:.2f}%")

# Generate comprehensive report
health_analyzer.generate_report("battery_health_report.pdf")
```
